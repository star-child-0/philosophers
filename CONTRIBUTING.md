# Contributing

If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improvement, feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repository, or directly contact me at:
- 42born2code Slack: anvannin
- E-Mail: anvannin@student.42firenze.it

Pull requests are also welcome, however, this is a school project, so I likely won't accept any pull request untill I turned it in.
