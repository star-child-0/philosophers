# üçù Philosophers

I never thought philosophy would be so deadly.

## üìñ Overview

This project is an implementation of the famous Dining Philosophers Problem in C. The Dining Philosophers Problem is a classic synchronization problem in computer science, where a group of philosophers sit at a table and eat spaghetti. There are as many forks on the table as the number of philosophers, and each philosopher needs two forks to eat. The problem is to design a solution where the philosophers can eat without getting into a deadlock.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To run this project, you need to have a C compiler and `make` installed on your system. If you're using Linux or macOS, you probably already have them installed.

First, clone this repository by running the following command:
```
git clone
```

Once you have a C compiler and `make` installed, you can clone this repository and compile the program by running the following command/s:

```
cd philo
make
```
for the mandatory part of the project, and
```
cd bonus
make
```
for the bonus part of the project.

This will compile the program and create two executables file called `philo` and `bonus` in the relative directory.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

To run the program, navigate to the project directory and run the following command/s:

```
./philo <number_of_philosophers> <time_to_die> <time_to_eat> <time_to_sleep> [<number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat>]
```
or, for the bonus part:
```
./bonus <number_of_philosophers> <time_to_die> <time_to_eat> <time_to_sleep> [<number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat>]
```

- `number_of_philosophers`: The number of philosophers and forks on the table. This argument must be greater than 1.
- `time_to_die`: The time in milliseconds after which a philosopher dies if they don't start eating.
- `time_to_eat`: The time in milliseconds it takes for a philosopher to eat.
- `time_to_sleep`: The time in milliseconds the philosopher will spend sleeping after they finish eating.
- `number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat`: The number of times each philosopher must eat. If this argument is not provided, the program will stop only when a philosopher dies.

## ‚úÖ Mandatory part

The solution is implemented using mutexes and threads. Each philosopher is a thread, and each fork is a mutex. The program is designed ...

## ‚≠ê Bonus part

The solution is implemented using semaphores and threads. Each philosopher is a thread, and each fork is a semaphore. The program is designed ...
